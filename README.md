# Fluid-Dynamics-Applications
The files in this repository are Graphical User Interfaces built in MATLAB
For my CBE 331 Fluid Dynamics class, each student is required to build one application in MATLAB to extend the solution to a relevant fluid dynamics problem.  As an honors student, I have to complete several "Honors Options" in order to graduate.  Honors Optioning a class requires that the student extend the activities in class, so when I chose to honors option CBE 331, rather than completing 1 GUI, I had to complete 7.  

The 7 GUIs presented here cover the range of our coursework, and seek to explore the topics in creative ways.
